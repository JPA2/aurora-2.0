# aurora-2.0
My first attempts at a CMS using Laminas Framework
I should state here that this is a development playground at the moment and is in no way to be used by others.
This work is based largely upon the documentation and examples from the Laminas examples and cookbook as well as the mvc skeleton. I am currently just testing and figuring out the best ways to port my content management system from ZF1 to Laminas and as such things will change as I learn more of the new framework and the best way to do things the "Laminas" way. I will also add to this. Aurora is just the codename for this project. It will not be released under that name. If it is ever released.
